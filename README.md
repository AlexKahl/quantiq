In this project I am building a performance and riskattribution webapplication for private investors.
To keep things simple the tool will only work for US equities as a start.
Prototyping this version will be done using Alpha Vantage data.

two major user stories shall be considered!

1) actual portfolio analysis
Given a portofolio with actual weights and tickers
Performance and Risk attribution shall be performed on a historical bases

2) Analysing a user's trading strategy in retrospect
Given a user's transaktions a complete performance and risk attribution shall be provided
